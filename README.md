### Notes
- Trying to get new icons and launch screens was a major hassle:
- Icon/Image sets were extremely difficult to work with, and had to wrestle with build settings to get anything to function. 
- Creating multiple image assets was annoying; It would be so much easier if Xcode just worked off one master high resolution. image that it scaled down, perhaps with different options for extremely low resolution images or versions with transparency.   
- Old launch screen and/or icon kept appearing on tests until Xcode was fully shutdown and restarted.
- Changing the Tab Bar icon color was difficult to find out.
- Custom Colors are still unwieldy to work with, especially across multiple computers. Though I plan on looking into "Color Assets" in the future).
